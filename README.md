# Space-Travels
## Next-JS, Prisma, Tailwind

This space travel website was built for the purpose of learning prisma. Users can sign in with either google or github and the users information is recorded in prisma model user. Upon signing in the users can register for a ticket. After registering the users are navigated to the booking page where they can delete or update their ticket

Check out the [Live Demo](https://space-travels-jade.vercel.app/#home)

## Skills Aquired

-   Prisma
-   Next Auth and prisma integration

### Problems Faced
- In the booking page i found that whenever an update was made it would not reflect in booking page. In order to solve this I referred to this [article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/nextjs/refreshing-server-side-props/) which was very informative.

### Conclusion
Prisma allows developers to interact with the database without writing any queries which is a huge win. Futhermore, prisma works seamlessly with next auth and next js. This allows even front end developers to build fullstack application with ease. It was fun trying out this and i planto use it more in my future projects.
Feel free to clone this project which has CRUD functionalities. This will give you the basic knowledge needed to learn prisma. Make sure to add the database url in your env file for this to work.
